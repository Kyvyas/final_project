####Technology used
* Ruby on Rails
* Javascript and JQuery
* PostgreSQL
* Action Mailer for email notifications
* Bootstrap + Custom CSS
* Paperclip with AWS for photo storage
* Mapbox and Leaflet JavaScript APIs for Mapping
* Rspec, Capybara, TimeCop, Factory Girl for testing

####Challenges
* Considering time was a major obstacle - hiding activities after they have taken
place, but saving them into the database to allow users to give them a rating.
* Allowing users to update the activity location on the confirmation page was very tricky.
The solution was very streamlined, we used a geocoder to get an initial location, enabled
the pin to be dragged and dropped, reverse geocoded the new location and used JavaScript
to update the form - all in real-time
* Constructing the database model accurately - We had to use a has and belongs to many
relationship between User, Activities, and Attendees.
